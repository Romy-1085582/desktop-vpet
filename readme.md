Don't worry if things look a little rough, I'm mostly just working on building a good foundation and architecture <3 But I wanted to put it in a public repo so you can try out some pre alpha versions!!

## How to run: (It's not compiled yet sorry :P)
- Ensure you have python installed and clone the repository to a local one
- Open a terminal and change directory to the project directory
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run ```python .\src\main.py```

## Controls in this development version:
- Press Backtick (`) to open the debug menu.
- Press E to open your item panel, and drag from there to spawn items.
- Press P to toggle the pixelation filter (off by default). Atm this just makes text in UI completely unreadable but i'll render this on a seperate layer later <3
